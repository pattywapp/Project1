                </div>
                <p>Calle Crisologo owes its name to the illustrious Ilocano poet, writer, and playwright Governor Marcelino “Mena” Crisologo. Previously, the street was called Calle de Escolta de Vigan, whose residents were mostly families who profited from the galleon trade that included Ilocos as a key port. When Governor Crisologo died in 1927, the street was renamed Calle Crisologo in his honor.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Calatagan is one of the best places in Batangas if you wanted a beach not too far from Manila. It is very accessible and could only take about 3 to 4 hours drive via Tagaytay-Nasugbu road. We traveled from Cavite and it only took us 2 hours to drive going here. This municipalicity is known for its sandy shores making it also good as a camping destination. Burot and Stilts are one of the most popular and most visited beaches here in Calatagan. Maybe you have not heard yet about the island that they call here as Little Boracay and Sand Bar?</p>

                <p>Yes, they said that the sunset was perfect here. 
                    But the sun hid from us that day.
                    It was just the scattering of light rays in different directions that was present.  
                    I guess it wasn't our lucky day. 
                    But even so, I still believe that it still an awesome experience.
