            Cagsawa Ruins tours offer the most iconic view of Mayon Volcano that's why it's one of the most-visited attractions in Legazpi. The church ruins are remnants of the interestingly heartbreaking stories of what was once an admired structure during the Spanish era.

            <h5>Best Time to Go</h5>

            <p>
            Legazpi City, the main destination for those visiting Mayon Volcano, is best visited during the dry months between March through May. Considerable amount of rainfall is expected from July to September.

            If you want to make the most out of your trip, visit Albay tourist spots with a view of Mayon Volcano early in the morning to avoid the big crowds excited to marvel at the majestic volcano.
Budget wise, it will be less costly to visit during the off-peak season which happens from November to December when not as many tourists travel to Legazpi.
