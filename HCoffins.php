        <h5>Why the coffins in Sagada are hanging?</h5>
        <p>One of the most common beliefs behind hanging coffins of Sagada is that moving the bodies of the dead higher up brings them closer to their ancestral spirits. Moreover, people were afraid to be burried in the ground as the dogs would destroy the body and the wet soil would make it quickly decompose. They wanted a place where their corpse would be safe.</p>
        <p>Another reason for hanging coffins of Sagada high up was risk of head hunters. Years ago during the headhunting days, enemies from a different province would hunt for their heads, and take them home as a trophy.</p>

            <h5>How to get to the hanging coffins of Sagada?</h5>
            <p>Sagada is a little village and very touristic place as it’s near the ancient terraces in Banaue. To see the hanging coffins of Sagada, you need to come to the Echo Valley. From tourist information turn right to get to the church. The entrance to the Echo Valley is just behind it. You will have to pay for the guide, as the tourism municipality requires. The guide costs 500 pesos so you better come with a group or join one to share the costs.</p>
            <p>Don’t miss seeing the hanging coffins on the way to Sumaguing Cave, which you can spot from the road. The original coffins are on the way to Sumaguing Cave, visible on the left side, on the rocks. Those are the first hanging coffins of Sagada and you can even see the joint hanging down from one of them. The coffins are on the other side of the valley, so you need a good camera zoom or binocular.</p>
            <p>Third place where you can spot the coffins, is when going to Lumiang cave which is connected with Sumaguing cave. As Sagada hanging coffins are spread in the whole valley, you will have a chance to see more of them when getting to the cave.</p>

            <h5>Sagada’s hanging coffins today</h5>
            <p>The interesting part is that the tradition of hanging coffins in Sagada is still alife, but not on the same scale as before. The last funeral like that was in 2010, and the person was Christian. It’s fascinating how the ancient tradition blands with Christianity brought by the colonizers from Spain.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, fewer elders want to be buried in a traditional way. As they are Christian, they want to be able to visit their relatives tombs in the All Saints Day. With Sagada’s hanging coffins is quite difficult to climb up and put the candle. Therefore, the tradition is disappearing.</p>
