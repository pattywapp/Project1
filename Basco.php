            <h5>Basco Lighthouse</h5>
        <p>Standing at 66 feet, the Basco Lighthouse towers over the island of Batan and is one of the three main lighthouses in the province of Batanes. It has also served as a guide for the local fisherfolk since it was constructed in 2003. This six-story structure also houses a viewing deck on its fifth floor, which provides a fantastic 360-degree view of the West Philippine Sea, Mt. Iraya, and the Basco town proper. </p>

            <h5>Best time to visit</h5>
           <p>It's recommended to visit the lighthouse in the summer season, which usually starts in March and ends in the latter weeks of May. During these months, there are fewer chances of rainfall, so you can better enjoy the fantastic view of Batanes from the lighthouse's viewing deck.</p>
