            <h5>Chamantad-Tiñan </h5>
         <p>The Chamantad-Tiñan ViewpointIt's renowned for its curvy grass-carpeted scenery. The rolling hills conquering the area come in a variety of
             low and high slopes giving visitors different perspectives. The highest slope hilltop provides the best view of Chamantad Cove. 
             A short walk here will take you to the seascape lined with powdery sand and small to medium-sized stones.</p>
             <p>Before reaching the hilltop, there are plenty of huts along the highway offering a sample of their local
                 sugarcane wine and Ivatan wild tea called tubho. </p>
                 <p>Including sightseeing and relaxing in the mountains, you can also find locals, known as Ivatans,
                     roaming around to borrow their traditional clothes–the Vakul and Kanayi, for photography purposes. 
                     Vakul is their native headgear for sun and rain protection, while Kanayi is a sleeveless jacket they 
                     usually wear when farming.</p>

            <h5>Best time to visit</h5>
          <p>The best time to visit the Chamantad-Tiñan Viewpoint in Sabtang Island depends on your preferences and what you hope to experience. 
            However, generally speaking, the months between November and May are considered the best times to visit due to the more favorable weather
             conditions. During these months, you can expect drier weather with less chance of rain, allowing for clearer views and 
             more enjoyable outdoor activities.</p>
             <p>Keep in mind that Sabtang Island, like the rest of the Philippines, can experience occasional typhoons and heavy rains during the
                 wet season from June to October. While the views may still be spectacular during this time, it's essential to check weather forecasts 
                 and plan accordingly to ensure a safe and enjoyable visit.</p>
